Me and the group members made a little plan on how the project should go. It was a big step where I felt we made progress.

I have created a container for Burger Order with Dockerfile. Before this I never knew about Docker so it was all new to me. I learned how to create a Docker file and add “layers”. But I’m still learning about it, for example I don't know yet how to connect different containers.

Today my group mates had a meeting discussing the situation. One of the members has done impressive steps with the app which I'm very proud of. I also gave suggestions and ways to make the app better and we have come to ways to make it better.

I’m gonna try to make the kitchen view container with Docker, and learn how to connect containers together therefore connecting Burger Order and Kitchen View.

I think this meeting was a good meeting and which helped clear things out.
