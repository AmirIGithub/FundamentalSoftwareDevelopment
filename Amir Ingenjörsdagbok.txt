Did a full debug of every part of the project to make sure everything works
(See reference in Inl√§mningsuppgift 3)
Debug session:
Today I decided to start a debugging session in VSCODE. I started with putting a breakpoint in the BurgerOrder app.py. I attempted to work my way through the program and progressively comment out certain parts of the program to see how it would react to the change. As expected, when I commented out certain parts or certain variables, the code didnt work. I did the same thing in BurgerOrder, tried different routes to see if no matter what choice I did, that it would end up in Kitchenview. For example putting an empty cart, which worked but as expected, nothing appeared in the KitchenView.

The session went well because our app isnt that complicated and theres not many room for bugs. The session went as I interpreted.
